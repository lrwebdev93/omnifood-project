HTML
NAVIGATION BAR: Will use <ul class=""> (unordered list), with each button having it's own <li><a href=""> tags.
SECTION VS DIV: Section defines a block of a document, div has no meaning at all and simply represents it's children elements.
HEADINGS: There should only be 1x <h1>, subsequent will be <h2> - <h6> (can have multiple of each of these).

CSS
FLOAT: Will place an element to the left or right of its container, allowing text/inline elements to wrap around it.
TRANSITION: Adds an over time effect, such as colour filling a button you hover over.
BUTTONS/LINKS: Add an hover/active(btn) or link/visited(link) selector to dictate what happens when a button/link is active or clicked.
WORD-SPACING: Tidy up between letters.
